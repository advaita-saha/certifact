# DeCert - A Decentralized Certification Service

We are proving a simple fast API to ed-tech businesses to make their certificates into NFTs and send to the receiver. We are making the NFTs non-transferable so maintain the legitimacy of the certificates
This provides complete ownership of the certificate to the receiver and the data cannot be altered for lifetime, as it relies on blockchain immutable ledger technology
Users will also get a single platform to showcase their certificates. And due to some reason we shut down operations, the certificates of the users will still remain with them for lifetime, no one can tamper with it.
